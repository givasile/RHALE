- example_2.py: figures used at Section 4.1(b)
- example_3.py: figures used at Section 4.1(c)
- example_bin_splitting_1.py: figures used at Section 4.2(a)
- example_bin_splitting_2.py: figures used at Section 4.2(b)
- real_dataset_3.py: figures used at Section 5

Each script stores the photos in a directory with the same name, 
e.g. concept_figure.py -> ./concepte_figure/
